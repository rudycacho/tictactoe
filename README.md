# Tic-Tac-Toe Assignment


This code creates a working version of tictactoe using IMGUI and was built using a Windows 11 computer. As for the design process it was relatively simple with the TODO's provided as it painted a clear picture of what to do. I also attempted to add some simple logs using my logger from the previous assignment, but for some strange reason it would cause weird bugs with the winner select and the string updater. Besides those flaws it seems pretty seamless and was fun to work on.
